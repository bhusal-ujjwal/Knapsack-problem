# Knapsack-problem
- Implement the Knapsack problem (KP) in Python and find the best solution using the brute force method.

## Problem description:
- All items are generated randomly, and each item has the following properties:
- The Volume of the item
- Cost of the item

## The knapsack has some maximal limit of Volume, which can't be violated.
- For the output, print all the items (their cost and volume). 
- And the best-found solution (which items are put together and the maximum cost and volume of the combination). 
- Also, print the total time needed for the brute force method.
